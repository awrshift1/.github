  Decision-making framework for AI agents.<br>
  Research before building. Evidence before assumptions. You decide everything.

**awrshift** (Awareness Shift) teaches your AI to research before building. Instead of jumping from problem to solution, your AI investigates first, proposes options with trade-offs, and pauses at human checkpoints for your approval.

**3 modes. Up to 6 human checkpoints. Works with any AI. 0 dependencies.**

### Get Started

**Claude Code / Windsurf** — one command, fully automatic:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awrshift1/awrshift/main/install.sh | bash
```

Just start talking. Your AI already knows the entire framework.

**ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude.ai** — copy the [awrshift prompt](https://github.com/awrshift1/awrshift/blob/main/framework/prompt.md) into any conversation.
